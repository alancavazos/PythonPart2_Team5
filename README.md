# PythonPart2_Team5

Team 5 consists of Ashlynn H, Alan C, Hunter T, and Kevin N

This is Team 5's group project #4.

Project #4 builds off of project #3 concepts and uses the same HTTP data log from "https://s3.amazonaws.com/tcmg476/http_access_log".

With the data log, we need to create a program in which it finds:

-How many requests were made on each day?

-How many requests were made on a week-by-week basis? Per month?

-What percentage of the requests were not successful?

-What percentage of the requests were redirected elsewhere?

-What was the most requested file?

-What was the least requested file?

Each log needs to be broken into 12 separate files where the data stored in each file are the log events for a single month.
